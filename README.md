Analysis of customer behavior and profitability
- Project description: 
Yandex.Afisha is a service created by Yandex and Afisha, the top Russian site for films and television programs. This service allowes Russians to search showtimes of plays and films through-out Russia, check availability of tickets, and pre-purchase them online.

- I have been given the task to explore:
   - How people use the product?
   - When do they start to buy?
   - How much money each customer brings?
   - When do they pay off?  

- In order to achieve this goal, i have been given access to:
  - Server logs with data on Yandex.Afisha visits from June 2017 to June 2018.
  - Dump file with all orders for the period.
  - Marketing expenses statistics
